### Hi!

We, at VIA, are trying to solve one of the most critical problems in Web3, in your opinion â€“ bad cross-chain experience. It's too hard to be part of two or more ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and Near.

**New users don't have to deal with DEXs and cross-chain bridges!**

That's why we developed the cross-chain liquidity aggregator and NFT sell function for GameFi.
