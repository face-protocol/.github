### Hey ✌️!

We at VIA are trying to solve one of the most critical problems in Web3, in your opinion, the bad cross-chain experience. 
It's too hard to be part of two or more ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana and Near.

**New users don't need to deal with DEX and bridging!**

That's why we developed the cross-chain liquidity aggregator and NFT cross-chain selling feature for GameFi.

Join our community to build a Mastercard for Web3!
